# Equation of the regression line of x on y
# 20x - 9y - 107 = 0

# Given y
y = 7

# Substitute y into the equation and solve for x
x = (9 * y + 107) / 20

# Print the result rounded to one decimal place
print(round(x, 1))


#explanation: we are asked to predict the value of x here which means we need to substitute the values of y in the equation 2 and solve for x
